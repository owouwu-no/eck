    //     Input: distance from home to work, price of ticket, miles the car can go per gallon
    //     Process: distance/mpg=g, distance*.05=cm, g*4=cg, cm+cg=price for car trip, check if car trip > train ticket or train ticket > car trip
    //     Output: if car trip is less expensive tell user about using car trip, if train ticket is less expensive tell user about using trains
